2. Improve poor existing matches if better source available  
3. Find new matches for unmatched fields using unused sources
4. Mark as NO_MATCH if truly no suitable source exists

RULES:
- Treat all numbers as decimal values
- Match based on field names and section contexts
- Same field name in different sections can use different sources
- Geographic translations: "North America" ↔ "United States and other North America"

RETURN CSV FORMAT: source_id,dest_id,confidence_score,match_reason

Include ALL 199 destination fields in your response.

You are an expert financial data analyst. I need you to match source fields to destination fields based on their semantic meaning and hierarchical context.

TASK: Match EVERY destination field to the most appropriate source field if a good match exists. Process ALL 199 destination fields.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. IMPORTANT: The SAME field name can appear in DIFFERENT sections and should map to corresponding destination sections
   - Example: "High-power CW lasers" in "Revenue by product" section
   - Example: "High-power CW lasers" in "Revenue by product (% of total)" section
   - Each should map to their corresponding destination section
2. Match based on section context and field names:
   - "Revenue by region" section should match "Region breakdown" fields
   - "Revenue by region (% of total)" section should match "Region mix %" fields  
   - "Revenue by application" section should match "End market breakdown" fields
   - "Revenue by product" section should match "Segment breakdown" fields
3. Geographic field name translations:
   - "North America" ↔ "United States and other North America"
   - "Other Europe" ↔ "Other including Eastern Europe/CIS"
   - "Other Asia" ↔ "Other Asian countries"
4. Treat ALL numbers as decimal values - don't distinguish between percentages and absolutes
5. Return matches with confidence >0.6 (60%)
6. For fields with no good match, return: NO_MATCH,dest_id,0.0,No suitable source field found

RETURN FORMAT: CSV with headers: source_id,dest_id,confidence_score,match_reason

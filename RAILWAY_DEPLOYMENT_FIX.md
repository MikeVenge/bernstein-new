# Railway Deployment Fix for Quarterly Earning Field Mapper

## 🚨 Issue: Railway Build Failed

The error shows Railway is trying to build from the project root instead of the `backend` directory and can't find the Python application.

## ✅ Solution: Configure Railway Service Settings

### **1. Railway Service Configuration**

In your Railway dashboard for project `a33c9b9d-889b-427d-aba8-6240ca22d770`:

**Go to Service Settings:**
- **Root Directory**: `backend` ⚠️ **CRITICAL - SET THIS**
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `./start.sh`
- **Language**: `Python`

### **2. Files Added for Railway**

I've created these files to fix the deployment:

- **`backend/start.sh`**: Executable startup script
- **`backend/runtime.txt`**: Python version specification  
- **Updated `backend/railway.json`**: Proper build configuration
- **`backend/railway_config.py`**: Environment-based configuration

### **3. Environment Variables (Already Set)**

Your Railway environment variables are correct:
- ✅ `CORS_ORIGINS`: `https://bernstein-eight.vercel.app`
- ✅ `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`: `production`  
- ✅ `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`: `a33c9b9d-889b-427d-aba8-6240ca22d770`

### **4. File Structure for Railway**

Railway should build from the `backend` directory:

```
backend/                     ← Railway root directory (SET THIS)
├── main.py                  ← FastAPI application
├── requirements.txt         ← Python dependencies
├── start.sh                 ← Startup script (NEW)
├── runtime.txt              ← Python version (NEW)
├── railway.json             ← Railway configuration
├── railway_config.py        ← Environment config
└── parameterized_field_mapper.py
```

### **5. Railway Dashboard Steps**

1. **Go to your Railway project**: `a33c9b9d-889b-427d-aba8-6240ca22d770`
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to Settings**
4. **Set Root Directory**: `backend`
5. **Set Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. **Set Start Command**: `./start.sh`
7. **Redeploy**

### **6. Alternative: Manual Railway Setup**

If the automatic detection still fails:

1. **Create new service** in Railway
2. **Connect GitHub repository**
3. **Set service settings**:
   - Root Directory: `backend`
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### **7. Expected Railway URL**

After successful deployment:
- **Backend API**: `https://backend-production-a33c.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: `https://backend-production-a33c.up.railway.app/`
- **API Docs**: `https://backend-production-a33c.up.railway.app/docs`

### **8. Update Vercel After Railway Deployment**

Once Railway gives you the backend URL, update Vercel environment variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-actual-railway-url.up.railway.app
```

## 🎯 Key Fix

**The main issue is Railway needs to know to build from the `backend` directory, not the project root.**

Set **Root Directory** to `backend` in Railway service settings, and the build should succeed!

You are an expert financial data analyst. I need you to match source fields to destination fields based on their semantic meaning and hierarchical context.

TASK: Match each destination field to the most appropriate source field. Return ONLY a CSV with the matched pairs.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Each source field should map to AT MOST ONE destination field (one-to-one mapping)
2. Pay attention to percentage vs absolute value contexts:
   - "Revenue by region" (absolute values) should match "Region breakdown" 
   - "Revenue by region (% of total)" (percentages) should match "Region mix (%)"
   - "Revenue by application" should match "End market breakdown"
   - "Revenue by product" should match "Segment breakdown"
3. Geographic terms should match: "North America" ↔ "United States and other North America"
4. Only return matches where you are confident (>70% confidence)
5. Return CSV format with headers: source_id,dest_id,confidence_score,match_reason
